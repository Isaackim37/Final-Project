        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Hello! This is Isaac Kim, an undergraduate student at Temple UNiversity studying Natural Science! I Built this website in order to convery my childhood love for pokemon. This site features a small pokedex of the first generation and also a team builder so that you can plan your league-winning team! The idea of this came from the idea of competetive pokemon battling and how many players use resources similar to this. However, most resources are much more deeper than this but this was my inspiration for that.</p>
